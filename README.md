# Review Carrousel

## About?

In this little project, I worked on using react-icons library. Which is a quick way to import icons into the app as components.

```zsh
npm install react-icons --save
```

needs to be ran in the terminal to install the package. To use just import whichever icon you want.
The first two letters of the icon name are the name of the directory in the react-icons library.

In addition, I worked with using the modulo operator in creating the logic of the previous and next item of the carrousel.

Finally, a random button was implemented to show a random person. If the number is the same, it is added 1. If the number that is repeated is 3, then it becomes 4. Therefore 4 % 4 = 0 and that is the number that is shown.

In the Alternative.jsx we can find a more conventional way of going around the carrousel.
